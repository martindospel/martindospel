### Hi and welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

My name is Martin Dospel. I am a passionate creator and problem solver who loves to learn new things. 

I am currently employed as a software developer consultant at [SALT](https://www.salt.dev/sv-SE). 

🔭 Recently, I've been collaborating on TrackMate V2 (GoLang, React Native). Here's the [Code](https://github.com/sayedmurtaza24/trackmatev2). 
  
🔭 I am also working on a Blog website (NextJS, Tailwind, GraphQL). 

🌱 In my spare time, I am learning more about AWS, GoLang and always deepening my knowledge of JavaScript.
